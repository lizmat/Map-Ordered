NAME
====

Map::Ordered - role for ordered Maps

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Map::Ordered;

my %m is Map::Ordered = a => 42, b => 666;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Exports a `Map::Ordered` role that can be used to indicate the implementation of a `Map` in which the keys are ordered the way the `Map` got initialized.

Since `Map::Ordered` is a role, you can also use it as a base for creating your own custom implementations of maps.
